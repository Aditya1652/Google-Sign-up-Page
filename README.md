This project involves developing an interactive multi-step form that mimics the Google Account signup process. The form is divided into multiple sections, guiding users through different stages of account creation, including entering personal information (name, birthday, gender), creating a username, and setting a password.

The key features of the project include:

Multi-Step Form Navigation:

The form is broken into several sections, each focusing on specific user inputs. Users can navigate through the form using "Next" buttons, and the current section is highlighted while the others are hidden.
Client-Side Validation:

Each section incorporates validation to ensure that the input data meets specified criteria. This includes validating the day, month, and year for the birthday, checking the username format, and enforcing password strength rules (e.g., at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, one special character, and a minimum of 8 characters).
Password Visibility Toggle:

Users can choose to show or hide their password by toggling a checkbox, enhancing usability during password entry.
Error Handling and Alerts:

If the input data does not meet validation criteria (such as a mismatch between the password and confirmation), the form displays alerts, highlights incorrect fields, and prevents progression until corrections are made.
Local Storage:

Once the form is completed successfully, the user's data is stored in the browser's local storage as JSON, simulating account creation without a backend server.

This project showcases skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on form validation, UI/UX design, and DOM manipulation
